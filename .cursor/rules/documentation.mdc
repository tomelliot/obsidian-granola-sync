When writing documentation files:

- be clear, but concise
- use diagrams to illustrate where it adds clarity
    - use mermaid diagrams
- if a documentation file is over 200 lines long, break it into multiple smaller files
- avoid putting code snippets from the repo into the README.md (they'll get stale). Reference the filename instead
- add README.md files throughout the repo hierarchy, not just at the root
