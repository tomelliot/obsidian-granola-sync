# Branch Naming Convention

When working on GitHub issues, use the following branch naming pattern:

```
issue/[issue_number]
```

## Examples

- For issue #15: `issue/15`
- For issue #42: `issue/42`
- For issue #123: `issue/123`

## Rationale

This convention makes it easy to:
- Identify which issue a branch addresses
- Track related branches and PRs
- Maintain consistency across the repository
